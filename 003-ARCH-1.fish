> Weaving quantum principles into classical security paradigms

## 🌌 Overview

STARWEAVE's quantum components form the foundation of our next-generation security approach, combining quantum-aware detection with classical security principles.

## 🔮 Core Components

### 1. Quantum Pattern Detector

The Quantum Pattern Detector (QPD) is designed to identify potential quantum-based threats by analyzing:
- Quantum signature patterns
- Entanglement anomalies
- Superposition state variations
