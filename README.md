# ✨ STARGUARD

> A quantum-aware, self-evolving defense system designed to protect against both classical and quantum threats.

## 🌟 Vision

STARGUARD is pioneering the next generation of system protection by combining quantum-aware security principles with evolutionary algorithms. Built primarily in Zig for performance and safety, it leverages cutting-edge defense mechanisms to safeguard systems in an increasingly complex threat landscape.

## 💫 Key Features

- **Quantum-Aware Detection**: Designed to identify and protect against both classical and potential quantum-based threats
- **Self-Evolving Architecture**: Continuous learning and adaptation to new threat patterns
- **Zig-Powered Core**: High-performance, safety-focused implementation
- **Fish Shell Automation**: Streamlined build and testing processes
- **STARBURN Integration**: Continuous security validation through quantum-enhanced penetration testing

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
